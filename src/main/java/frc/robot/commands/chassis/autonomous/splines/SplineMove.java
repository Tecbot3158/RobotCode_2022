     * Creates a new autonomous command in which the robot will follow the given
     * trajectory.
     * 
     * @param spline         The spline that defines the trajectory that this
     *                       command will follow.
     * @param maxSpeed       The maximum speed that will be given to the robot at
     *                       any given time.
     * @param speedReduction True if the robot needs to stop at the end of the
     *                       command. False is useful when concatenating paths.
     * @param vertical       The default axis settings are: x-axis is paralell to
     *                       the guardrails, y-axis is paralel to the driver
     *                       stations. True if these settings need to be inverted.
     * @param inverted       By default, the trajectory is folllowed from left to
     *                       right. True if this setting needs to be inverted.
     * @param reverse        By default, the robot will follow the trajectory going
     *                       forward. True if the robot needs to follow the path
     *                       backwards.
